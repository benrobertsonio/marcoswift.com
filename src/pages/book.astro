          Marco Swift and the Mirror of Souls is a fantastical and imaginative middle-grade fantasy novel that touches on universal themes of forgiveness, truth, and love.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shaken by the sudden death of his father and his mother’s downward spiral into mental illness, when eleven-year-old Marco is approached by a magical enchantress who promises to cure his mother, he jumps at her offer. But in return, he must step through the Mirror of Souls and embark on a deadly quest to restore order to a wondrous but dying world.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thrown head-first into a struggle against fiendish monsters and the darkness lurking in his own soul, Marco must face off against enemies from within and without on a mission to restore the fabled sword of light – and along the way, he’ll unravel the secrets behind his father’s legacy and what really happened the day his dad died.
        </p>

          But time is running out. Unsure who to trust and brought face-to-face with a host of terrible creatures that are bent on his destruction, Marco must use all of his wits if he wants to defeat his enemies and save the World of Souls.
