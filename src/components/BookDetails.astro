                Marco Swift and the Mirror of Souls is a fantastical and
                imaginative middle-grade fantasy novel that touches on universal
                themes of forgiveness, truth, and love. Shaken by the sudden
                death of his father and his mother’s downward spiral into mental
                illness, when eleven-year-old Marco is approached by a magical
                enchantress who promises to cure his mother, he jumps at her
                offer. But in return, he must step through the Mirror of Souls
                and embark on a deadly quest to restore order to a wondrous but
                dying world.
